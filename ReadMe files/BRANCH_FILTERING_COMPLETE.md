# Branch Filtering Implementation - Complete

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### Overview
All pages now support dynamic branch filtering. Users can select a specific branch from a dropdown to view data for that branch only, or select "All Branches" to see data from all locations.

---

## üéØ Frontend Updates

### Pages Updated with Branch Filtering:

#### 1. **Rooms Page** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/pages/Rooms.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `branches` state to store all branches
- Added `filterBranchId` state (default: 'All')
- Fetch branches from `/api/branches` on component mount
- Pass `branch_id` parameter to `/api/rooms` when filter changes
- Added dropdown selector UI before other filters
- Re-fetch rooms whenever branch filter changes

**UI Location:**
- Filter section: "Filter by Branch" dropdown
- Position: First filter (before Status and Type filters)

**How it Works:**
- User selects a branch from dropdown
- Frontend sends `branch_id=X` to backend API
- Backend filters rooms WHERE `r.branch_id = X`
- Only rooms from selected branch are displayed

---

#### 2. **Bookings Page** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/pages/Bookings.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `branches` state and `filterBranchId` state
- Fetch branches on mount
- Combined branch filter with status filter in API call
- Added dropdown selector in filters section

**UI Location:**
- Filter section: "Filter by Branch" (4-column layout)
- Position: Left of "Filter by Status"

**How it Works:**
- User selects branch
- API called with both `status` and `branch_id` parameters
- Backend filters bookings by branch through room join
- Statistics cards updated to show filtered data

---

#### 3. **Guests Page** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/pages/Guests.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `branches` state and `filterBranchId` state
- Fetch branches on mount
- Pass `branch_id` to `/api/guests/all` API
- Redesigned filter UI to include branch selector

**UI Location:**
- Inside Card.Header
- Two-column layout: Branch filter (left) + Search (right)

**How it Works:**
- User selects branch
- Backend filters guests who have bookings in that branch
- Uses EXISTS subquery to check booking-room-branch relationship

---

#### 4. **Services Page** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/pages/Services.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `branches` state and `filterBranchId` state
- Filter applies ONLY to "Service Usage" tab (not catalog)
- Pass `branch_id` to `/api/service-usage` API
- Added dropdown above tabs

**UI Location:**
- Before service statistics cards
- Label: "Filter Service Usage by Branch"

**How it Works:**
- Service Catalog: No filter (global services)
- Service Usage: Filtered by branch
- Backend joins through booking ‚Üí room ‚Üí branch

---

#### 5. **Billing Page** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/pages/Billing.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `branches` state and `filterBranchId` state
- Applied to both Payments and Adjustments tabs
- Pass `branch_id` to both billing APIs
- Added dropdown before statistics cards

**UI Location:**
- After page title, before statistics
- 4-column layout

**How it Works:**
- Filters payments by booking's room branch
- Filters adjustments by booking's room branch
- Statistics recalculated for filtered data only

---

#### 6. **Reports Page** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/pages/Reports.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `branches` state and `filterBranchId` state
- Branch filter added to report generation controls
- Applied to all report types (Revenue, Occupancy, Service Usage, Payment Methods)
- Pass `branch_id` parameter to all report APIs

**UI Location:**
- Report Generation card
- Between "Report Type" and "Group By" selectors

**How it Works:**
- User selects branch before generating report
- Backend applies branch filter to all queries
- Reports show data only for selected branch

---

## üîß Backend Updates

### Controllers Updated with Branch Filtering:

#### 1. **roomcontroller.js** ‚úÖ
**Function:** `getAllRooms()`

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Added parameter
const { ..., branch_id, ... } = req.query;

// Added filter
if (branch_id) {
    query += ` AND r.branch_id = $${++paramIndex}`;
    params.push(branch_id);
}
```

**Effect:** Filters rooms directly by branch_id

---

#### 2. **bookingcontroller.js** ‚úÖ
**Function:** `getAllBookings()`

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Added parameter
const { ..., branch_id, ... } = req.query;

// Added filter  
if (branch_id) {
    query += ` AND r.branch_id = $${++paramIndex}`;
    params.push(branch_id);
}
```

**Effect:** Filters bookings by room's branch (via JOIN)

---

#### 3. **guestController.js** ‚úÖ
**Function:** `getAllGuests()`

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Added parameter
const { ..., branch_id, ... } = req.query;

// Added filter with EXISTS subquery
if (branch_id) {
    paramCount++;
    whereConditions.push(`EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM booking b 
        JOIN room r ON b.room_id = r.room_id 
        WHERE b.guest_id = g.guest_id AND r.branch_id = $${paramCount}
    )`);
    params.push(branch_id);
}
```

**Effect:** Filters guests who have at least one booking in the selected branch

---

#### 4. **billingController.js** ‚úÖ

**Function 1:** `getAllPayments()`
```javascript
// Added parameter
const { ..., branch_id, ... } = req.query;

// Added filter
if (branch_id) {
    query += ` AND r.branch_id = $${++paramIndex}`;
    params.push(branch_id);
}
```

**Function 2:** `getPaymentAdjustments()`
```javascript
// Same changes as getAllPayments
```

**Effect:** Filters payments and adjustments by booking's room branch

---

#### 5. **serviceUsageController.js** ‚úÖ
**Function:** `getAllServiceUsages()`

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Added parameter
const { ..., branch_id, ... } = req.query;

// Added filter
if (branch_id) {
    whereClause += ` AND r.branch_id = $${++filterParamIndex}`;
    filterParams.push(branch_id);
}
```

**Effect:** Filters service usage by booking's room branch

---

#### 6. **reportsController.js** ‚úÖ
**Function:** `fetchReport()` (Frontend)

All report API calls now include `branch_id` parameter when not "All":
- Revenue Report
- Occupancy Report  
- Service Usage Report
- Payment Methods Report

**Note:** Backend reports controller already supported branch filtering via optional `branch_id` parameter.

## üìä Database Relationships

### How Branch Filtering Works:

```
Branch (3 branches)
   ‚Üì
Room (60 rooms, each belongs to 1 branch)
   ‚Üì
Booking (1000 bookings, each has 1 room)
   ‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Payment (1657 payments)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Payment Adjustment (refunds)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service Usage (1000 records)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Guest (151 guests)
```

**Filter Logic:**
- **Direct:** Rooms filter directly on `room.branch_id`
- **Via Room:** Bookings, Payments, Adjustments, Service Usage filter via JOIN to room
- **Via Booking:** Guests filter using EXISTS subquery through booking ‚Üí room

---

## üé® UI Components

### Branch Selector Dropdown:

**Pattern Used Across All Pages:**
```jsx
<Form.Group>
  <Form.Label>Filter by Branch</Form.Label>
  <Form.Select 
    value={filterBranchId} 
    onChange={(e) => setFilterBranchId(e.target.value)}
  >
    <option value="All">All Branches</option>
    {branches.map(branch => (
      <option key={branch.branch_id} value={branch.branch_id}>
        {branch.name}
      </option>
    ))}
  </Form.Select>
</Form.Group>
```

**Features:**
- Bootstrap Form.Select component
- Dynamic options from `/api/branches`
- "All Branches" default option
- Clean, consistent styling across all pages

---

## üîç API Endpoints

### Branches API:
```
GET /api/branches
Returns: List of all branches with branch_id and name
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    { "branch_id": 1, "name": "Colombo", ... },
    { "branch_id": 2, "name": "Kandy", ... },
    { "branch_id": 3, "name": "Galle", ... }
  ]
}
```

### Updated API Endpoints (with branch_id support):
```
GET /api/rooms?branch_id=X
GET /api/bookings?branch_id=X
GET /api/guests/all?branch_id=X
GET /api/service-usage?branch_id=X
GET /api/billing/payments?branch_id=X
GET /api/billing/adjustments?branch_id=X
GET /api/reports/revenue?branch_id=X
GET /api/reports/occupancy?branch_id=X
GET /api/reports/service-usage?branch_id=X
GET /api/reports/payment-methods?branch_id=X
```

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

### Frontend Testing:
- [x] Rooms page: Branch dropdown loads and filters correctly
- [x] Bookings page: Branch filter works with status filter
- [x] Guests page: Branch filter shows guests with bookings in that branch
- [x] Services page: Usage tab filters by branch (catalog unaffected)
- [x] Billing page: Payments and adjustments filter by branch
- [x] Reports page: All report types respect branch filter

### Backend Testing:
Test each endpoint with `branch_id` parameter:
```bash
# Test Rooms
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/rooms?branch_id=1&limit=5"

# Test Bookings
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/bookings?branch_id=1&limit=5"

# Test Guests
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/guests/all?branch_id=1&limit=5"
