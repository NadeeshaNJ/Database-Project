# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide for SkyNest Hotel Management System

## 📋 Overview

This guide explains the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline set up for your SkyNest Hotel project using GitHub Actions.

## 🎯 What We've Set Up

### Two GitHub Actions Workflows:

1. **Full CI/CD Pipeline** (`ci-cd.yml`)
   - Comprehensive testing and validation
   - Runs on: main and develop branches
   - Multiple jobs for frontend, backend, security, and quality checks

2. **Quick Check** (`quick-check.yml`)
   - Fast validation for quick feedback
   - Runs on every push to main
   - Basic syntax check and build

## 📁 File Structure

```

│       ├── ci-cd.yml           # Full pipeline
│       └── quick-check.yml     # Quick validation

## 🚀 How It Works

### When You Push Code:

```
1. You commit changes
   ↓
2. Push to GitHub
   ↓
3. GitHub Actions automatically runs
   ↓
4. Pipeline executes:
   ✓ Installs dependencies
   ✓ Checks for syntax errors
   ✓ Builds React application
   ✓ Runs security scans
   ✓ Checks code quality
   ↓
5. You see results in GitHub
   ✅ Green checkmark = All good!
   ❌ Red X = Something failed
```

## 📊 Pipeline Jobs Explained

### 1. Frontend Build & Test
```yaml
What it does:
- Checks out your code
- Installs npm packages
- Checks for JavaScript errors
- Builds React app
- Saves build files as artifacts
```

**Why it's important:**
- Ensures code compiles without errors
- Catches build issues before deployment
- Validates all dependencies work together

### 2. Backend Build & Test
```yaml
What it does:
- Checks backend code
- Installs backend dependencies
- Validates server.js syntax
- Runs linting (if configured)
- Runs tests (if configured)
```

**Why it's important:**
- Ensures backend API is valid
- Catches Node.js syntax errors
- Validates database connections

### 3. Code Quality Analysis
```yaml
What it does:
- Checks project structure
- Looks for TODO/FIXME comments
- Finds console.log statements
- Validates file organization
```

**Why it's important:**
- Maintains code standards
- Tracks technical debt
- Ensures clean production code

### 4. Security Scan
```yaml
What it does:
- Runs npm audit for vulnerabilities
- Checks for hardcoded passwords
- Looks for exposed API keys
- Validates dependencies
```

**Why it's important:**
- Protects against security threats
- Identifies vulnerable packages
- Prevents credential leaks

### 5. Integration Report
```yaml
What it does:
- Combines results from all jobs
- Generates summary report
- Shows overall pipeline status
```

**Why it's important:**
- Quick overview of build health
- Easy to see what passed/failed
- Helps track project quality

## 🔧 How to Use

### Automatic (Recommended)

Just push code to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main
```

The pipeline runs automatically! Check status at:
```
https://github.com/NadeeshaNJ/Database-Project/actions
```

### Manual Trigger

You can also run workflows manually:
1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Select a workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose branch
5. Click green "Run workflow" button

## 📈 Reading the Results

### On GitHub:

**Green checkmark (✅):**
```
All jobs passed!
✅ Frontend: Built successfully
✅ Backend: No errors
✅ Security: No issues
✅ Quality: Meets standards
```

**Red X (❌):**
```
Something failed - click to see details
❌ Frontend: Build failed
   - Check error logs
   - Fix the issue
   - Push again
```

**Yellow dot (🟡):**
```
Pipeline is running...
Wait for completion
```

## 🎨 Status Badges

Add this to your README.md to show build status:

```markdown
![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/NadeeshaNJ/Database-Project/workflows/SkyNest%20Hotel%20Management%20System%20CI%2FCD/badge.svg)
```

## 🛠️ Customizing the Pipeline

### Adding Tests

1. Create test files:
```javascript
// src/App.test.js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders app', () => {
  render(<App />);
  expect(screen.getByText(/SkyNest/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

2. Add test script to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "react-scripts test --watchAll=false"
  }
}
```

3. Tests will run automatically in pipeline!

### Adding Linting

1. Install ESLint:
```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint
```

2. Add lint script:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src/"
  }
}
```

3. Pipeline will run it automatically!

### Adding Environment Variables

In GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions:
```
DATABASE_URL: your-database-connection-string
API_KEY: your-api-key
```

Use in workflow:
```yaml
- name: Run with secrets
  run: npm start
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Setup (Optional)

To auto-deploy when pipeline passes:

```yaml
deploy:
  name: Deploy to Production
  needs: [frontend, backend, code-quality, security]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to server
      run: |
        # SSH to your server
        # Pull latest code
        # Restart services
        echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## 📝 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's:

1. **Push to branches, merge to main**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-branch-filter
   # Make changes
   git push origin feature/new-branch-filter
   # Create Pull Request on GitHub
   ```

2. **Review pipeline results before merging**
   - Wait for green checkmark
   - Review any warnings
   - Fix issues before merge

3. **Keep builds fast**
   - Cache dependencies
   - Run only necessary tests
   - Parallelize jobs

4. **Use meaningful commit messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: Dashboard statistics not updating"
   git commit -m "Feature: Add global branch filtering"
   git commit -m "Refactor: Remove dummy data from Reservations"
   ```

### ❌ Don'ts:

1. **Don't commit secrets**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use GitHub Secrets instead
   - Check before pushing

2. **Don't ignore pipeline failures**
   - Red X means something is wrong
   - Fix before merging
   - Don't bypass checks

3. **Don't commit node_modules**
   - Already in .gitignore
   - Slows down pipeline
   - Wastes storage

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Fails on "npm install"

**Problem:** Dependency installation fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Locally test:
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install

# If works, commit new package-lock.json
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update package-lock.json"
git push
```

### Pipeline Fails on "npm run build"

**Problem:** Build errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test locally:
npm run build

# Fix any errors shown
# Common issues:
# - Unused variables
# - Missing imports
# - Syntax errors
```

### Pipeline is Slow

**Problem:** Takes too long to run

**Solution:**
1. Enable dependency caching (already enabled)
2. Reduce job scope
3. Skip jobs on non-code changes
4. Use matrix builds for parallel testing

### Pipeline Doesn't Run

**Problem:** No workflow triggered

**Check:**
1. Is file in `.github/workflows/` folder?
2. Is YAML syntax correct?
3. Is branch name correct in `on:` section?
4. Are Actions enabled in repo settings?
