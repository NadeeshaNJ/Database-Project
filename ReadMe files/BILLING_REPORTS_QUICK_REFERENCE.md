## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If data doesn't load:
1. Check backend is running (http://localhost:5000)
2. Check database connection (PostgreSQL on)
3. Open browser console (F12) to see errors
4. Check Network tab for failed API calls

### Common Issues:
- **"Cannot connect":** Backend not running → Start with `npm start` in Database-Back folder
- **"Empty data":** Database issue → Check PostgreSQL is running
- **"401 Unauthorized":** Login required → Login first for protected routes
- **"No data":** Date range too narrow → Clear filters or expand date range
