# 🔧 Customer Portal Database Schema Fix

## 🐛 Issues Found

1. ❌ **Room Type dropdown not working** - Wrong field name
2. ❌ **Special requests field doesn't exist** - Not in database schema
3. ❌ **Wrong table structure** - Fields didn't match actual `pre_booking` table

---

## 📊 Actual Database Schema

### **pre_booking** Table Structure (from your database):
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.pre_booking (
    pre_booking_id bigint NOT NULL,
    guest_id bigint NOT NULL,
    capacity integer NOT NULL,              -- ✅ Total guests
    prebooking_method public.prebooking_method NOT NULL, -- 'Online', 'Phone', 'Walk_in'
    expected_check_in date NOT NULL,        -- ✅ Not check_in_date
    expected_check_out date NOT NULL,       -- ✅ Not check_out_date
    room_id bigint,                         -- ✅ Optional - can be NULL
    created_by_employee_id bigint,          -- Optional
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

### **Fields Comparison**:

| What I Created Before | What Database Actually Has |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| ❌ branch_id | ✅ room_id (optional) |
| ❌ room_type_id | ✅ room_id (optional) |
| ❌ check_in_date | ✅ expected_check_in |
| ❌ check_out_date | ✅ expected_check_out |
| ❌ num_adults | ✅ capacity (total guests) |
| ❌ num_children | ✅ capacity (total guests) |
| ❌ special_requests | ❌ Doesn't exist |
| ❌ status | ❌ Doesn't exist |

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Backend API** (`routers/booking.js`)

**Before** (Wrong Schema):
```javascript
{
  guest_id, branch_id, room_type_id, check_in_date, check_out_date,
  num_adults, num_children, special_requests, status
}
```

**After** (Correct Schema):
```javascript
{
  guest_id,               // FK to guest table
  capacity,               // Total number of guests
  prebooking_method,      // 'Online', 'Phone', 'Walk_in'
  expected_check_in,      // Check-in date
  expected_check_out,     // Check-out date
  room_id                 // Optional - specific room or NULL
}
```

### 2. **Customer Portal Form** (`CustomerPortal.js`)

**New Form Fields**:
- ✅ Check-in Date → `expected_check_in`
- ✅ Check-out Date → `expected_check_out`
- ✅ Number of Guests → `capacity` (single field for total guests)
- ✅ Preferred Location → `branch_id` (for filtering rooms only, not saved)
- ✅ Select Room → `room_id` (optional - customer can leave blank)
- ✅ Booking Method → `prebooking_method` (always 'Online' for web)

**Removed Fields**:
- ❌ Room Type dropdown (doesn't exist in schema)
- ❌ Number of Adults (replaced with single capacity field)
- ❌ Number of Children (replaced with single capacity field)
- ❌ Special Requests (doesn't exist in database)

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Customer Journey**:

1. **Select Dates**:
   - Choose check-in date
   - Choose check-out date

2. **Enter Capacity**:
   - Total number of guests (adults + children)
   - Range: 1-10 guests

3. **Optional: Select Location & Room**:
   - Can choose preferred branch (Colombo/Kandy/Galle)
   - If branch + dates selected → See available rooms
   - Can select specific room OR leave blank
   - If left blank → Staff will assign best room

4. **Submit Pre-Booking**:
   - Data saved to `pre_booking` table
   - `prebooking_method` = 'Online'
   - `room_id` = selected room OR NULL
   - Staff reviews and confirms later

## 📝 Database Flow

```
Customer Portal Form
        ↓
{
  guest_id: 7 (from logged-in user),
  capacity: 2,
  prebooking_method: 'Online',
  expected_check_in: '2025-10-25',
  expected_check_out: '2025-10-28',
  room_id: 15 (or null if not selected)
}
        ↓
POST /api/bookings/pre-booking
        ↓
INSERT INTO pre_booking (
  guest_id, capacity, prebooking_method,
  expected_check_in, expected_check_out, room_id
) VALUES (7, 2, 'Online', '2025-10-25', '2025-10-28', 15)
        ↓
Returns: { pre_booking_id: 123 }
```

2. Select:
   - Check-in: 2025-10-25
   - Check-out: 2025-10-28
   - Guests: 2
3. Do NOT select location or room
4. Submit
5. ✅ Pre-booking created with room_id = NULL
```

### **Test Scenario 2: Pre-booking with specific room**
```
1. Login as customer
2. Select:
   - Check-in: 2025-10-25
   - Check-out: 2025-10-28
   - Guests: 2
   - Location: Colombo

## 📊 Database Query to Check

After submitting a pre-booking, check the database:

```sql
SELECT 
    pb.pre_booking_id,
    pb.guest_id,
    g.name as guest_name,
    pb.capacity,
    pb.prebooking_method,
    pb.expected_check_in,
    pb.expected_check_out,
    pb.room_id,
    r.room_number,
    b.branch_name,
    pb.created_at
FROM pre_booking pb
LEFT JOIN guest g ON pb.guest_id = g.guest_id
LEFT JOIN room r ON pb.room_id = r.room_id
LEFT JOIN branch b ON r.branch_id = b.branch_id
ORDER BY pb.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ New row with your data
- ✅ `capacity` = number you entered
- ✅ `prebooking_method` = 'Online'
- ✅ `room_id` = selected room OR NULL
- ✅ Dates match what you selected
