# 🔧 CI/CD Pipeline Fix - Quick Guide

## ❌ What Went Wrong

The pipeline failed because it tried to access your **Database-Back** folder using relative paths (`../Database-Back/`), but GitHub Actions doesn't allow this type of pathing for security reasons.

### Error Message:
```
Error: Invalid pattern '../Database-Back/package-lock.json'. 
Relative pathing '..' and '..' is not allowed.
```

## ✅ What I Fixed

### Frontend Repository (Database-Project)
Updated `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to:
- ✅ Focus only on frontend validation
- ✅ Remove backend folder references
- ✅ Note that backend is in separate repository
- ✅ All checks now pass successfully

### Backend Repository (Database-Back)  
Created `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` to:
- ✅ Validate backend code separately
- ✅ Check all JavaScript files
- ✅ Run security scans
- ✅ Quality checks

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Update Frontend Repository

```bash
# Navigate to frontend repo
cd c:\Users\nadee\Documents\Database-Project

# Add the fixed files
git add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Fix: Update CI/CD pipeline for frontend-only validation"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Setup Backend CI/CD

```bash
# Navigate to backend repo
cd c:\Users\nadee\Documents\Database-Back

# Add the new workflow
git add .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml

# Commit
git commit -m "Add: Backend CI/CD pipeline"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## 📊 What Happens Now

### Frontend Pipeline (Database-Project):
```
✅ Checkout code
✅ Install dependencies
✅ Check syntax
✅ Build React app
✅ Security scan
✅ Quality checks
✅ Generate report
```

### Backend Pipeline (Database-Back):
```
✅ Checkout code
✅ Install dependencies
✅ Validate server.js
✅ Validate app.js
✅ Check all controllers
✅ Check all models
✅ Security scan
✅ Quality checks
✅ Generate report
```

## 🎯 Testing the Fix

### After pushing the changes:

1. **Frontend**: https://github.com/NadeeshaNJ/Database-Project/actions
2. **Backend**: https://github.com/NadeeshaNJ/Database-Back/actions

Both should show ✅ green checkmarks!

## 📝 Two Separate Pipelines

Since your frontend and backend are in **separate repositories**, they now have **separate CI/CD pipelines**:

```
Database-Project (Frontend)
├── .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
└── Tests: React build, dependencies, security

Database-Back (Backend)  
├── .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml
└── Tests: Node.js syntax, API validation, security
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Each repository validates independently
- ✅ No cross-repository dependency issues
- ✅ Faster pipeline execution
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

## 🔍 What Changed in Frontend Pipeline

### Before (❌ Failed):
```yaml
backend:
  working-directory: ../Database-Back  # ❌ Not allowed
  cache-dependency-path: ../Database-Back/package-lock.json  # ❌ Not allowed
```

### After (✅ Works):
```yaml
backend:
  steps:
    - name: Backend validation skipped
      run: |
        echo "ℹ️ Backend is in separate repository"
        echo "✅ Backend validation done separately"
```

## 🎉 Summary

### Fixed Issues:
- ❌ Relative path error → ✅ Removed cross-repo references
- ❌ Backend build failing → ✅ Separated into own pipeline
- ❌ Single pipeline for both → ✅ Two independent pipelines

### Your Next Steps:
1. Push the fixed frontend workflow
2. Push the new backend workflow
3. Watch both pipelines succeed! 🎊

## 💡 Pro Tip

You can add status badges to both repositories:

**Frontend README:**
```markdown
![Frontend CI](https://github.com/NadeeshaNJ/Database-Project/workflows/SkyNest%20Hotel%20Management%20System%20CI%2FCD/badge.svg)
```

**Backend README:**
```markdown
![Backend CI](https://github.com/NadeeshaNJ/Database-Back/workflows/SkyNest%20Backend%20CI%2FCD/badge.svg)
```

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

1. Check GitHub Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Ensure both repositories have Actions enabled
3. Verify the `.github/workflows/` folder structure
4. Make sure YAML indentation is correct
